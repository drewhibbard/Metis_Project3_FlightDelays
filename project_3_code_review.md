## Clean Code & Documentation

- Very clean and concise code
- Great README.md
- Markdown cell at beginning of .ipynb explains scope and analyis
- Use more inline code comments and markdow cells to explain your process/thoughts. You did this in the modeling
  notebook, but apply to the other notebooks as well. 

Proper Data Science:

- Excellent job using four data sets, especially flightware
- Reminder you can use regular and random grid search to find the optimal parameters for Xgboost. Use random because the regular grid search takes to long.
- Good job finding the ,ensembling models might take time to train but once you have trained them the evaluation/test for new data should not take far less time.
  That being said, you might have been able to find a combination of models that performed better than Xgboost. 
  

## Comments:

- Wonderful App!! 
- Loved the approach/project design and how it can be easily understood from a technical and non-technical audience. 
- Great work.
